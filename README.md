Emulating OBLIQUE: Le Page, Y. J. Appl. Cryst. 2002, 35, 175-181.
The programme OMEGA represents my attempt to reproduce the calculations of obliquity, ω, 
carried out by Yvon Le Page’s OBLIQUE programme, which was originally implemented online. 
The programme ceased to be available a few years after the original publication appeared, 
from what I could learn.  Beginning in the 2013-2014 academic year, I embarked on a search 
for the original source code and/or any executables.  My extensive efforts led to many 
suggestions and promises, all to no avail.  After a few years, I decided to abandon the search, 
leaving open the hope that copies would nonetheless materialize in the future.  It then seemed 
prudent, as my workload at Brandeis University diminished owing to a retirement contract, to write 
a version that would reproduce the extant data,1 as well as (hopefully) including some or all of 
the obliquity data not found by the original programme, as noted in two excellent publications 
by Grimmer and Grimmer & Kunze.
